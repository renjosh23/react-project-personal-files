# react-project-personal-profile

React Redux application for managing personal notes.

A complete Single-Page-Application (SPA) created using React JavaScript library. We have used Redux for state management and Bootstrap for styling the UI. We are interacting with a RESTful API which is protected using JWT.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Backend REST API Node server**

   As this React app is consuming a REST API, make sure the same is up and running on your system
   - the complete code is available [here](https://github.com/renjosh23/personal-profiles-api.git) at GitHub
   
2. **Clone the React app repo from GitHub**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/renjosh23/react-project-personal-files.git
   ```
3. **Install npm dependencies**
   ```sh
   cd react-project-personal-profile
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run npm start to start the application**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   this runs the application at port 3000 and we can access from http://localhost:3000
